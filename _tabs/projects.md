## 📐 Engineering & CAD
**Aerodynamic Rocket Component Suite (Nose Cones & Fins)** (ongoing)

*Parametric 3D modeling for flight stability and structural integrity.*

- **Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
- **Technical Focus:** Utilizing **spline geometry** for low-drag ogive nose cone profiles and **parametric constraints** to ensure fin symmetry.
- **Details:** Currently developing a modular nose cone assembly. This project focuses on the transition from 2D sketches to 3D lofted bodies, ensuring wall thickness is optimized for 3D printing (FDM) while maintaining structural rigidity.
- **Key Skill:** Bridging the gap between mathematical flight requirements and physical 3D geometry.
